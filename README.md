Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic applcation of engineering principles, methods, and tools to development nd mantainance of high quality softwares.
Its importance is that it enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Programming Languages development
2. software engineering as a displine was established
3. Rise of structured programming and agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2.Design: Software architectures designs of high quality.
3.Implementaytion: Writing codes and building software according to designs.
4.Testing: conducting various testing to ensure quality standards are met.
5.Deployment: Releasing the software product to users.
6.Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall method: its a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing like a waterfall eg:Banking software while Agile: its an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexbility, collaboration and responding to change. eg: moble development app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  1.Software development: Responsible for writing software solutions.
  2.Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  3.Project Manager: oversees planning execution and delivery of sotware projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments: they are crucial software engeenering tools for writing, debigging and testing code eg Visual studio.
Version Control Systems: they are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among members.eg git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing Environment
2.Tight deadlines
3.Technical debt

strategies to overcome these challenges:
1.Effective comminication
2.Agile methodologies
3.Prioritization of task

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing: this a type of testing where you test individual componets or modules
intergration testing: testing interactions between different components of subsystem
acceptance testing :testing against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

importance:
it helps avoid confusion by making your questions clear and specific so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt :
is a bmw car engine good
improvement:
is a b58 engine good -> specified the type of engine i want to know about
